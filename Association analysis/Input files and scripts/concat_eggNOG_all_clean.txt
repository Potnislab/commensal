The properties and activities of the enzyme are changed at Chi.

Holoenzyme degrades any linearized DNA that is unable to undergo homologous recombination. In the holoenzyme this subunit has ssDNA-dependent ATPase and 5'-3' helicase activity.

Catalysis occurs through a double-displacement mechanism. The nucleophile active site attacks the C1' of nucleotide 34 to detach the guanine base from the RNA, forming a covalent enzyme-RNA intermediate. The proton acceptor active site deprotonates the incoming PreQ1, allowing a nucleophilic attack on the C1' of the ribose to form the product. After dissociation, two additional enzymatic reactions on the tRNA convert PreQ1 to queuine (Q), resulting in the hypermodified nucleoside queuosine (7-(((4,5-cis-dihydroxy-2- cyclopenten-1-yl)amino)methyl)-7-deazaguanosine)","tgt","ko:K00773","-","TGT"

The properties and activities of the enzyme are changed at Chi. The Chi-altered holoenzyme produces a long 3'-ssDNA overhang and facilitates RecA-binding to the ssDNA for homologous DNA recombination and repair.

HprK P also catalyzes the pyrophosphate-producing, inorganic phosphate-dependent dephosphorylation (phosphorolysis) of seryl-phosphorylated HPr (P- Ser-HPr). The two antagonistic activities of HprK P are regulated by several intracellular metabolites, which change their concentration in response to the absence or presence of rapidly metabolisable carbon sources (glucose, fructose, etc.) in the growth medium. Therefore, by controlling the phosphorylation state of HPr, HPrK P is a sensor enzyme that plays a major role in the regulation of carbon metabolism and sugar transport it mediates carbon catabolite repression (CCR), and regulates PTS-catalyzed carbohydrate uptake and inducer exclusion","-","-","-","-"

HprK P also catalyzes the pyrophosphate-producing, inorganic phosphate-dependent dephosphorylation (phosphorolysis) of seryl-phosphorylated HPr (P- Ser-HPr). The two antagonistic activities of HprK P are regulated by several intracellular metabolites, which change their concentration in response to the absence or presence of rapidly metabolisable carbon sources (glucose, fructose, etc.) in the growth medium. Also phosphorylates dephosphorylates the HPr-like catabolite repression protein crh on a specific serine residue. Therefore, by controlling the phosphorylation state of HPr and crh, HPrK P is a sensor enzyme that plays a major role in the regulation of carbon metabolism and sugar transport it mediates carbon catabolite repression (CCR), and regulates PTS-catalyzed carbohydrate uptake and inducer exclusion","hprK_1","ko:K06023","-","Hpr_kinase_C,Hpr_kinase_N"

"10980","OG0017255","L","A helicase nuclease that prepares dsDNA breaks (DSB) for recombinational DNA repair. Binds to DSBs and unwinds DNA via a highly rapid and processive ATP-dependent bidirectional helicase activity. Unwinds dsDNA until it encounters a Chi (crossover hotspot instigator) sequence from the 3' direction. Cuts ssDNA a few nucleotides 3' to the Chi site. The properties and activities of the enzyme are changed at Chi. The Chi-altered holoenzyme produces a long 3'-ssDNA overhang and facilitates RecA-binding to the ssDNA for homologous DNA recombination and repair. Holoenzyme degrades any linearized DNA that is unable to undergo homologous recombination. In the holoenzyme this subunit has ssDNA-dependent ATPase and 5'-3' helicase activity. When added to pre-assembled RecBC greatly stimulates nuclease activity and augments holoenzyme processivity. Negatively regulates the RecA-loading ability of RecBCD","-","ko:K03581","-","AAA_30,HHH_4,UvrD_C_2,Viral_helicase1"
